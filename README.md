Uplo is a decentralized cloud storage platform secured by blockchain technology. The Uplo storage network leverages underutilized hard drive capacity around the world to create a data storage marketplace that is more reliable and lower cost than traditional cloud storage providers. Uplo has its own blockchain, and a utility token that powers it â€“ the UploCoin.

Your data is truly private and gets stored across the globe to eliminate any single point of failure and ensure the highest possible uptime. Since you hold the keys, you own your data. No outside company can access or control your files.

Data cannot be de-platformed. Files can not be hacked.

## Uplo is here for good

Not only is your data safe on Uplo, but you can feel confident that Uplo isn't going anywhere. Once Uplo is officially released, within a short time there would be enough users on the Uplo network that if the Uplo team quit tomorrow, the network can autonomously run forever.

Uplo will have an incredible ecosystem with renters, hosts, miners, and a teeming developer community building on Uplo.
