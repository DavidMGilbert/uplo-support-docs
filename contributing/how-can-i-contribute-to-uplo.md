# How can I contribute to Uplo?

If you've got some dev skills and free time, Uplo is here for you.

Uplo is 100% open source and development is held on Github. The Australian Uplo team have been the core developers of Uplo, but hundreds of individuals have contributed either to the core code or apps built on top of the network.

We hope to build a wonderful community, and we hope you'll find your place in it! Check the \#contributors channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/b2s3P9Cy6F) to say hi, ask questions, or get opinions on your Uplo-related code or app.
