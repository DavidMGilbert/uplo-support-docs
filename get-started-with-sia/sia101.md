# Uplo 101

Uplo has a few important terms that you'll want to get familiar with. These will be explained in more detail in their related sections, but here's a short sample.

* **Node:** Your instance or installation of Uplo.
* **Renter:** Someone who uploads files to the network.
* **Host:** Someone who lends their storage space so others can upload files to the network.
* **Contracts:** Formed between renter and host, contracts determine how much data is being stored, for how long, and at what price. These are automatically tracked and completed by the software and blockchain.
* **UploCoins:** The cryptocurrency that powers Uplo.
* **UploFunds:** A secondary, revenue-sharing token on the network that grants the holder UploCoins for every completed contract.

## What Uplo does

When a file gets uploaded to Uplo, it gets split up, encrypted, and sent all over the world. Renters upload files, hosts store those files, and everything is automated. Once you upload your files, the network ensures that they're always accessible to you by copying them multiple times. And they're never accessible to hosts because they only receive pieces of whole files that are already encrypted.

## Why it's here

Uplo’s core goal is to bring decentralization to data storage. We want you to be able to store your data in a way that gives you full, exclusive control. We want to make sure you're protected against theft, censorship, and that you are never denied access to your data by hackers, miners, developers, or a government body. Your data belongs to you.

## Who makes Uplo?

Uplo was conceived at HackMIT in 2013 by David Vorick and Luke Champine. Over time, the crew has grown into the US and EU-based Nebulous team, the core developers of Uplo.

## Community contribution

While there is a distinct development and operations team, dozens of individuals have contributed to the core code or apps built on top of the network. Check out our [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/uplo-tech/uplo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in writing code for Uplo and further decentralizing the project!

## **Renting on Uplo**

When you upload files to Uplo, you become a **renter**. You upload files to other users who have made their space available, called **hosts**. We use the term renter because Uplo creates contracts with other hosts:

* to store a certain amount of data
* for a certain period of time
* for a certain amount of money

## Hosting on Uplo

**Hosting** means you are contributing your excess storage space to Uplo. You're helping to keep data where it belongs – safely in the hands of those who uploaded it, the **renters**.

You also earn UploCoin, the cryptocurrency that powers the Uplo network. UploCoin can be used to purchase your own storage space, or converted to other cryptocurrency or fiat on crypto exchanges.

Hosts are a critical part of the ecosystem. You are contributing to the decentralized network that is the heart of Uplo.
