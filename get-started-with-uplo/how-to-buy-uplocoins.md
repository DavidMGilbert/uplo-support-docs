# How to buy UploCoins

Whether you want to upload files to the decentralized cloud or lend your extra storage space to the network, you need UploCoins to use Uplo. UploCoins can be sent to you once you make a Uplo address, or you can mine them. Otherwise, you’ll need to buy them.

UploCoins are available on a number of major exchanges like Binance, Bittrex, Kraken, Upbit, Poloniex, Huobi, OKex, and HitBTC. Get the full list [here](https://airtable.com/shrq4MSLNxinvnaR7).

Some exchanges support direct fiat \(local currency\) to UploCoin purchases, but others require you to buy Bitcoins, Ethereum, or other crypto to make your purchase. We’ll walk you through the process of buying your first UploCoins.

## What is KYC?

No, this isn't chicken related. KYC stands for Know Your Customer and is a set of identity verification rules that most exchanges have to follow to abide by local laws. This might include submitting scans of state or federal ID, or sending in your government ID numbers like a Social Security Number if you live in the US. You'll be guided through whatever KYC process your exchange of choice has.

## Buy UPLO from an exchange

This option gets you the best prices but has a fairly intense on-ramp for a new user.

This example will use [CoinSpot](https://www.coinspot.com.au/join/REFAZXMZJ), an Australian-based exchange that allows you to trade regular Australian dollars AUD\) for UploCoins and many other crypto-currencies. But the general process will be similar no matter which exchange you use.

* [Sign up for an account ](https://www.coinspot.com.au/join/REFAZXMZJ)with CoinSpot. The process is simple, but fairly long and requires identity verification along the way.
* Once signed up and verified, make a deposit to your CoinSpot wallet.
* Make a trade by specifying how many UploCoins you want to buy.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If this is your first time purchasing crypto, start with a small amount until you’re comfortable with it.
{% endhint %}

* Now you have the UploCoins in your CoinSpot wallet, but exchange wallets aren’t a good place to store crypto, and you can’t use it for its intended purpose - using Uplo.
* Transfer to your Uplo wallet by [making a Uplo address](how-to-buy-uplocoins.md) and then sending to it from CoinSpot.
