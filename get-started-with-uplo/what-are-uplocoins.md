# What are UploCoins?

UploCoins are the utility tokens that power the Uplo network. This article is included early on because anything you want to do on the network requires UploCoins, whether you want to hold or trade, or rent or host data.

UploCoins are used in lots of ways but serve a single purpose â€“ facilitating network operations. When you upload files to Uplo, you pay for that storage in UploCoins. If you're a host and you're storing other people's data, you get paid for that in UploCoins. If you own UploFunds, your share of Uplo network growth is paid out in, you guessed it, UploCoins.

You can send UploCoins to others, or receive them at your own wallet address. You can store them in our official software, or on a hardware or paper wallet. You can get UploCoins by having someone send them to you, buying them on an exchange, or mining them.

New UploCoins are only made by mining.  Uplo is going to be the storage layer of the internet, and billions of UploCoins will be required for the petabytes and exabytes of data that will be stored on Uplo.
