# About mining on Uplo

## Why Mine?

When you mine on a cryptocurrency network, you are contributing computing power to help process and verify transactions on that network. On the Uplo network, the blockchain contains not just UploCoin transactions, but also the smart file contracts between [renters](../renting/about-renting.md) and [hosts](https://github.com/DavidMGilbert/uplo-support-docs/tree/431ec4c4cb7b7fe1321203b069ebf4981995d762/hosting/about-hosting-on-uplo.md). Miners are the backbone of the network, verifying the integrity of the blockchain. On Uplo, miners are rewarded with UploCoins for their service.

## The Block Reward

The block reward is the miner's incentive to contribute their computing power and electricity cost to the network. When a block is successfully verified, or solved, an amount of UploCoins is paid out to those who mined the block.

When the Uplo network launched, the block reward was 300,000 UploCoins. This decreases by one every block, with a floor at 30,000 – which was reached at block 270,000 \(300,000 - block height\).

### Infinite Reward

Unlike Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrency blockchains, the Uplo block reward never stops. This means that miners will always have an incentive to be part of Uplo. Once the block reward reaches 30,000 coins, it stays there forever.

## Proof-of-Work

The Uplo blockchain runs on something called Proof of Work. Blockchains are an amazing thing, and they are versatile enough to power different platforms. They might power money, like Bitcoin. They might power utility and smart storage contracts, like Uplo. No matter what the blockchain is in charge of, you need to be sure that the money you send or the contracts you enter into never change.

A blockchain needs to be correct. There's no bank to record a transaction, and no third party to verify the validity of a contract. The whole reason anyone trusts a blockchain is because you don't need to trust anyone – you can be sure that the Bitcoin you receive is really yours; that the storage space you've rented on Uplo is really there for your data.

A lot of cost and resources go into verifying the transactions of a blockchain. Proof of Work provides a powerful stamp that says ‘this history cannot be changed without doing a lot of work and spending a lot of money’. In practice, that is a powerful deterrent.
