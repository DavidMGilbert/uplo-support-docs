# What are UploFunds?

You know all about UploCoins, the utility token used for automatically fulfilling Uplo's smart contracts. But what about UploFunds - the other token on the Uplo network?

UploFunds are tokens used for revenue sharing on the Uplo network; a 3.9% fee from every storage-related transaction on Uplo is distributed to the holders of UploFunds. The Uplo core team currently holds approximately 85% of all UploFunds.

When contracts are completed on the network, 3.9% of each funding source is reserved for Siafund holders. Funding sources for contracts are:

* Renter fees for storage
* Renter bandwidth costs
* Host collateral

At the end of a contract, the amount reserved is then dispersed to all Siafund holders equally.

## How to store UploFunds

UploFunds are stored in your wallet, right next to your UploCoins.

They are also sent to and received at normal UploCoin addresses, and can be restored with your UploCoin balance as long as you have your Uplo seed.

## Why UploFunds?

We created UploFunds in order to sustainably fund the development of the Uplo network.

We created UploFunds in order to sustainably fund the development of the Uplo network. UploFunds incentivize and enable us – and investors – to maintain and improve the Uplo network by capturing a share of revenue as the network grows. As more users pay for storage, Siafund revenues increase and more resources can be devoted toward Uplo development.

## Tokenized securities vs utility tokens

UploFunds were designated as securities by the SEC back in 2018. Utility tokens primarily derive their value from use on a blockchain platform, like UploCoins. UploFunds, by contrast, derive their value from the present and future value of the Uplo storage network.

## How many UploFunds are there?

The maximum number of UploFunds that will ever be issued is 10,000, all of which were generated upon the launch of the Uplo software in 2015. Because the number of UploFunds issued is fixed, as the number, size, and value of the contracts on the Uplo network increase, the amount of revenue per Siafund increases proportionally.

Nebulous, Inc. originally owned all 10,000, but over the years have conducted multiple Siafund sales to fund development. As of April 2019, Nebulous holds about 8,600, and the rest have been issues to third parties.
