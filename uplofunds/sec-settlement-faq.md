# SEC Settlement FAQ

### What was this settlement about?

In October of 2019, Nebulous settled an SEC claim relating to the unregistered May 2014 offer and sale of Sianotes and the June 2015 conversion of Sianotes into UploFunds. As reflected in the settled order, the SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the UploCoin token or any current activity on the Uplo network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the UploCoin token as a security with the SEC.

Upon completion of its investigation, and as reflected in the settled order, the SEC concluded that because UploFunds were securities, the failure to register the 2014 offering and 2015 conversion constituted violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.

## How does Uplo's two-token model work?

Uplo uses two tokens, **UploCoins** and **UploFunds**.

UploCoins are used for utility; renters buy storage space on the Uplo network with UploCoins and hosts are paid in UploCoins for selling their storage space. Hosts also post collateral in UploCoins, and miners mine UploCoins via Proof-of-Work.

UploFunds are used for **revenue sharing**; a 3.9% fee from every storage-related transaction on the Uplo network is distributed to the holders of UploFunds tokens.

We believe Uplo’s two-token model creates an ideal ecosystem, where the Uplo core team and Siafund investors are incentivized to focus on product development and long-term, sustainable network growth.

## How does the settlement impact the Uplo network?

The Uplo network is not impacted by the SEC settlement.

As reflected in the settlement, the SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the UploCoin token or any current activity on the Uplo network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the UploCoin token as a security with the SEC.

This means that after intense scrutiny and information gathering by the SEC, they decided to not modify, restrict, or suspend the Uplo network in any way.

## Does the settlement harm the Uplo project?

It does not. The SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the UploCoin token or any current activity on the Uplo network. The SEC did not pursue any criminal action against Nebulous or Uplo core developers.

In fact, the cryptocurrency community may decide that the settlement strengthens the Uplo project, as the SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the UploCoin token.

## Did the Uplo team knowingly sell unregistered securities in 2014?

No, we did not. At the time of the 2014 offering, we were not aware that Sianotes or UploFunds may be considered securities by the SEC. This offering took place months before the Ethereum offering and years before the SEC issued any cryptocurrency-related guidance.

Given that we properly registered our 2018 offering of UploFunds in the wake of the SEC’s 2017 guidance regarding digital assets, we are disappointed that the SEC chose to take action with respect to our relatively small 2014 offering.

## Tell me about UploCoins before we dive deeper.

UploCoins are used for utility on the Uplo network; renters buy storage space with UploCoins and hosts are paid in UploCoins for selling their storage space. Hosts also post collateral in UploCoins and miners mine UploCoins via Proof-of-Work.

Essentially, UploCoins are tokens that power the Uplo network – they are the network currency.

UploCoins were never used for fundraising, and the Uplo core team holds less than 0.1% of the total UploCoins supply.

UploCoins are mined via Proof-of-Work, and the Uplo core team pre-mined less than 0.1% of the total UploCoin supply at launch.

## Does this mean UploCoins are securities?

The SEC thoroughly examined UploCoins during the course of their investigation. The SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the UploCoin token or any current activity on the Uplo network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the UploCoin token as a security with the SEC.

## I don't see UploCoins mentioned in the settlement. Is the SEC aware of UploCoins?

The SEC thoroughly examined UploCoins during the course of their investigation. The Uplo core team briefed the SEC on how UploCoins have been used since the launch of Uplo in 2015 – strictly for utility on the network, and never used for fundraising.

During our conversations, the SEC displayed exceptional technical knowledge on all aspects of the network, including UploCoins.

## I am an exchange that currently lists UploCoins. What does this settlement mean for me?

Nothing! The SEC did not take any enforcement action with respect to the UploCoin token or any current activity on the Uplo network, and the order does not require Nebulous to register the UploCoin token as a security with the SEC. The SEC was well informed of how UploCoins are created and used, including that they are traded on a number of exchanges around the world. We can provide any exchange a copy of a legal opinion regarding UploCoin's status as it relates to US securities law.

## I hold or use UploCoins to rent cloud storage. What does this settlement mean for me?

Nothing! The SEC did not take any enforcement action regarding UploCoins in their ruling, despite being well informed of how UploCoins are created and used. If you rent, you can still use UploCoins for their intended purpose – renting cloud storage space on the Uplo network. If you hold UploCoins, you can still keep them in your wallet or trade them on any supported exchange.

## I mine UploCoin. What does this settlement mean for me?

Nothing! The SEC did not take any enforcement action regarding UploCoins in their ruling, despite being well informed of how UploCoins are created and used. Miners should feel comfortable continuing to mine UploCoins.

## Tell me more about UploFunds.

UploFunds are tokens used for revenue sharing on the Uplo network; a 3.9% fee from every storage-related transaction on Uplo is distributed to the holders of UploFunds. The Uplo core team currently holds approximately 85% of all UploFunds.

We created UploFunds in order to sustainably fund the development of the Uplo network. UploFunds incentivize and enable us – and investors – to maintain and improve the Uplo network by capturing a share of revenue as the network grows. As more users pay for storage, Siafund revenues increase, and more resources can be devoted toward Uplo development.

## Does this mean UploFunds are securities?

The SEC has designated UploFunds as securities according to United States laws. We expected this, and conducted our 2018 UploFunds offering in a legally-compliant manner via Regulation D. In this 2018 offering, we treated UploFunds as securities, and titled the offering “Tokenized Securities Offering” or “TSO.”

We recommend that you research the applicable securities laws in your country before buying or selling UploFunds.

If you are based in the United States, you may be required to be an accredited investor to buy or sell UploFunds. We recommend consulting with an attorney.

## Will you conduct future offerings of UploFunds?

We plan to conduct future offerings of UploFunds. The settlement does not prevent us from doing so. As in our 2018 offering, we will treat future offerings of UploFunds as securities – unless regulatory guidance changes in the future.

## I purchased UploFunds in the April 2018 offering. What does this mean for me?

The settlement does not affect your purchase of UploFunds in the April 2018 offering. We properly complied with regulations and conducted an SEC-compliant offering via Regulation D.

All UploFunds purchased in the 2018 offering were disbursed to investors after a one-year lockup period.

## I purchased UploFunds on an OTC channel or an exchange. What does this settlement mean for me?

The SEC has designated UploFunds as securities according to United States laws. If you purchased UploFunds on an OTC channel or a decentralized exchange, or are considering making a purchase, we recommend that you research the applicable securities laws in your country.

If you are based in the United States, you may be required to be an accredited investor to buy or sell UploFunds. We recommend consulting with an attorney.

## What is a Sianote?

Sianotes were precursors to UploFunds. We sold Sianotes to investors in 2014 and exchanged them for UploFunds in mid-2015 when the Uplo network launched.

Sianotes were sold for Bitcoin and issued on the NXT Asset Exchange.

## I purchased Sianotes in the 2014 offering and exchanged them for UploFunds. What does this settlement mean for me?

The SEC has designated UploFunds as securities according to United States laws. If you purchased Sianotes in the 2014 offering and exchanged them for UploFunds, we recommend that you research the applicable securities laws in your country.

If you are based in the United States, you may be required to be an accredited investor to buy or sell UploFunds. We recommend consulting with an attorney.
