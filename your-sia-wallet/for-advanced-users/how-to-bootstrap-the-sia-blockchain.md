# How to bootstrap the Uplo blockchain

We don't recommend that you bootstrap the Uplo blockchain. While there are many trusted sources, the best source is one you donâ€™t have to trust, Uplo itself.

When you bootstrap, you're taking the consensus file from someone else who has already downloaded it \(and potentially modified it\) and using it for your Uplo node. It's usually a lot faster than waiting for the Uplo blockchain to sync, but that's the only benefit.

While there are a number of trusted community members offering the consensus file to bootstrap, you should let your Uplo node sync the blockchain from the blockchain. Ironically, you should let your Uplo node pull itself up by its own bootstraps.
