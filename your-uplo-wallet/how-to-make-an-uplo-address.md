# How to make an Uplo address

At some point, you'll need to receive UploCoins. You might be sending them over from an exchange wallet, another Uplo wallet you own, or requesting UploCoins from a friend. No matter the reason, it's easy to generate an address in your Uplo-UI wallet to receive UploCoins.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also receive [UploFunds](../uplofunds/what-are-uplofunds.md) using one of these addresses. UploCoins **and** UploFunds can be sent to any address generated by Uplo.
{% endhint %}

Go to the Wallet in Uplo-UI. Click on the **Receive** tab.

Click **Generate New Address** to create a new UploCoin address.

Copy and paste this manually, or use the **Copy** button to the right to make sure you get the full address without any extra spaces.

Clicking **Generate New Address** again will move the Latest Address down a step, and create a brand new UploCoin address for you to use.

Once you receive UploCoins, you'll see a history in the **Transactions** tab. You'll see 0/6, then 1/6, and so on. This indicates how many blocks have passed since the transaction has been processed. At six confirmations, we deem the transaction to be fully confirmed and will show a green checkmark.
