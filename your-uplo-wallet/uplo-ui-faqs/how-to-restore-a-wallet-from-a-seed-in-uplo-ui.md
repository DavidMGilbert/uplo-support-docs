# How to restore a wallet from a seed in Uplo-UI

If you already have a Uplo seed with a balance of UploCoins, you can recover and use your UploCoins at any time by using Uplo-UI on your computer.

## Things You'll Need

* A desktop or notebook computer with a decent amount of available storage space. As of January 2021, you need 24 GB for the Uplo blockchain to download. This file will only get larger, so allocate some space to be able to grow with Uplo.
* Your Uplo seed.
* Uplo-UI installed. [Don't have Uplo-UI yet?](http://uplo.tech/get-started)
* The Uplo blockchain fully synced to Uplo-UI. Syncing can take hours on an SSD, and days on a traditional HDD.

## Restore from a seed

{% hint style="info" %}
Restoring from your seed does not restore a custom password. After following this process, you'll use your Uplo seed to log in to your wallet until you [set a custom password.](../how-do-i-change-my-uplo-wallet-password.md)
{% endhint %}

Go to the Wallet tab. If there's not another wallet setup already, you'll see two options: Create new wallet and Restore from seed. Click **Restore from seed.**

If the blockchain isn't fully synched, you'll receive a message telling you to wait. Uplo-UI needs to be fully synced because it needs to scan the blockchain for all your transactions.

Once the blockchain is synced, clicking Restore from seed will prompt you for your Uplo seed. It must be entered exactly as it was given to you: all lower-case letters, a space between each word, and no spaces at the beginning or end of the phrase. Enter your seed and then click **Next.**

Uplo-UI will then scan the blockchain.

That's it! Uplo's so smart, it even pulls your transaction history.
